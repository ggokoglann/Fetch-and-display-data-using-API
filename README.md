# Currencies_API

This study project is an enhanced version of the currencies app, incorporating the MVVM design pattern while fetching currency data from an API.




## Key Features

- Displays exchange rates for USD, EUR, GBP, BTC, ETH, and GOLD.
- Implements the MVVM design pattern for better separation of concerns and code organization.
- Uses a structured folder hierarchy, separating views, view models, models, and networking components.
- Fetches currency data from an API using the APIManager class.
- Utilizes URLSession to make network requests and JSONDecoder to parse API responses.
- Implements data binding between the view and view model to keep the UI up to date.
- Supports UICollectionView for a visually appealing display of currency rates.


  
## What do i learn ?

Through the development of this app, i have gained a deeper understanding of the MVVM architecture and its advantages in iOS app development. By separating the responsibilities of the view and view model, the codebase became more maintainable, testable, and scalable. We also explored networking concepts by fetching currency data from a REST API and parsing the JSON response. Additionally, we improved our skills in using UICollectionView to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
